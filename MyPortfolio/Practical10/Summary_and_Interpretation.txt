After running all three pairwise combinations of sequences, I got the BLOSUM scores and identity percent in each combination. Between mouse SOD2 sequence and human SOD2 sequence, BLOSUM score is 1091 and identity percent is 89.64%. Between random sequence and human sequence, BLOSUM score is -250 and identity percent is 5.41%. Between random sequence and mouse sequence, BLOSUM score is -250 and identity percent is 5.86%. There are high BLOSUM score and identity percent between mouse SOD2 sequence and human SOD2 sequence. Which means this two SOD2 sequence from mouse and human is similar. So, SOD2 protein have a similar structure and function in human and mouse. And they may have a same ancestor protein. However, between random sequence and SOD2 sequence of human or mouse, the BLOSUM score and identity percent is extremely low. Which means that they have a huge difference. Because random sequence is produced randomly.
