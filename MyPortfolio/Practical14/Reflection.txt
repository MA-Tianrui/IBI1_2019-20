It is easy to search for GO about autophagosome and extract id, name, and definition. However, it is hard to find how many childnodes each GO have. My solution is to find the first level childnodes. Then, use the first level childnodes to find the next level childnodes. Repeat until there is not next level childnode. The algorithm is effective and the program can finish in 1 minute.
